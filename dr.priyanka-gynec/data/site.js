        content: `Polycystic Ovary Syndrome affects roughly 1 in every 5 women of reproductive age. The primary hurdle in conceiving with PCOS is anovulation—infrequent or absent ovulation caused by hormonal imbalances like elevated androgen levels and insulin resistance. Because the ovary does not regularly release a mature egg, natural conception becomes unpredictable. However, it is essential to understand that women with PCOS possess abundant egg reserves; they simply require the right endocrine signals to release them.`

Focus on a low-glycemic index diet, regular resistance exercise, and managing insulin sensitivity through physician-guided supplements like Inositol or Metformin.`
